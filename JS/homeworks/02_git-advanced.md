# Git advanced homework

1. Register in github.com
2. Create or push existing repository to github
3. Create and push new branch with bunch of commits
4. Create merge request to master branch
5. Complete merge request. Read carefully about complete options. Try to understand what do they mean
6. Pull new changes from remote master to local
7. If you done all of this steps take a cup of tea or beer. You are almost git expert =)
