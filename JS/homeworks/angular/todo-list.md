# TODO list
Main goal is getting more familiar with angular basic concepts, built-in directives, data bindings etc. So you need to create an application according to next mockup. Feel free to use any styling for your app. Css libs like bootstrap also are allowed. 

Todo list is a application where you can simply add and remove any todo item. Every todo item is a simple string which describe a task what need to be done

![Todo list mockup](https://github.com/sir13tommy/front-kotany/blob/main/assets/todo_mockup.png!raw=true)

Requirements:
 * Every item need to contain two buttons, edit and remove (pencil and minus on mockup)
 * Click on edit button need to transform item into input field and user will enter a new text for current item. Edit button should transform into save and cancel buttons. Click on save will save current item with new text. Click on cancel will restore previous text for the item
 * Click on minus will remove this item from list
 * Click on "Add TODO" button should create a new todo item with empty input field and autofocusing into one

 Good luck üê±
