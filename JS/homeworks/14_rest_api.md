# REST API

Your task is to create full CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) client application. Feel free to write any html and css code for styling. Every operation should make a http request to the REST api server. Use this [server](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U9Ac5UNDiWXZ47PCR_8N3eMGFetsq7tU) for local development

App should cover next requirements
 1. Display list of users
 2. Form to add new user. Sould contain name, email, password
 3. Buttons to delete user near the user name
 4. Button to edit user. After clickin one near user should appear 3 input fields to edit name, email, password and button '‚úî' to save data at the server

P.S. you can use our [lesson project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kI6hOfBs1FX-vXZUQPsEfpL9TsWKBgm3) as reference but don't copy paste, write your own code

Good luck üê±)
